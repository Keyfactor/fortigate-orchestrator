## Overview

The Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension enables remote management of cryptographic certificates on Fortigate devices via Keyfactor Command. Fortigate devices use certificates to secure communications, authenticate users, and enforce security policies across networks.

In the context of this extension, defined Certificate Stores represent specific locations on the Fortigate device where certificates are stored and managed. These locations can include local user certificates, factory certificates, and other defined repositories. The Universal Orchestrator extension facilitates inventory, addition, renewal, and removal of certificates within these stores, streamlining the certificate management process for IT administrators.
