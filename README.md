## Overview

The F5 Orchestrator supports three different types of certificates stores with the capabilities for each below:

- CA Bundles
  - Discovery
  - Inventory*
  - Management (Add and Remove)
- Web Server Device Certificates
  - Inventory*
  - Management (Add, but replacement/renewal of existing certificate only) 
- SSL Certificates
  - Discovery
  - Inventory*
  - Management (Add and Remove)  

*Special note on private keys: One of the pieces of information that Keyfactor collects during an Inventory job is whether or not the certificate stored in F5 has a private key.  The private key is NEVER actually retrieved by Keyfactor, but Keyfactor does track whether one exists.  F5 does not provide an API to determine this, so by convention, all CA Bundle certificates are deemed to not have private keys, while Web Server and SSL certificates are deemed to have them.  Any Management jobs adding (new or renewal) a certificate will renew without the private key for CA Bundle stores and with the private key for Web Server or SSL stores.



## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.1 and later.

## Support
The Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension is open source and community supported, meaning that there is **no SLA** applicable. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


An administrator account must be set up in F5 to be used with this orchestrator extension.  This F5 user id is what must be used as credentials when setting up a Keyfactor Command certificate store pointing to the F5 device intending to be managed.


## Create the Fortigate Certificate Store Type

To use the Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the Fortigate Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.



* **Create Fortigate using kfutil**:

    ```shell
    # Fortigate
    kfutil store-types create Fortigate
    ```

* **Create Fortigate manually in the Command UI**:
    <details><summary>Create Fortigate manually in the Command UI</summary>

    Create a store type called `Fortigate` with the attributes in the tables below:

    #### Basic Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Name | Fortigate | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
    | Short Name | Fortigate | Short display name for the store type |
    | Capability | Fortigate | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
    | Supports Add | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
    | Supports Remove | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
    | Supports Discovery | âœ… Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
    | Supports Reenrollment | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
    | Supports Create | ðŸ”² Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
    | Needs Server | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
    | Blueprint Allowed | âœ… Checked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
    | Uses PowerShell | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
    | Requires Store Password | âœ… Checked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
    | Supports Entry Password | ðŸ”² Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

    The Basic tab should look like this:

    ![Fortigate Basic Tab](docsource/images/Fortigate-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Advanced Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
    | Private Key Handling | Required | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
    | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

    The Advanced tab should look like this:

    ![Fortigate Advanced Tab](docsource/images/Fortigate-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Custom Fields Tab
    Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

    | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
    | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |

    The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

    ![Fortigate Custom Fields Tab](docsource/images/Fortigate-custom-fields-store-type-dialog.png)



    </details>

## Installation

1. **Download the latest Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/fortigate-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `fortigate-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `fortigate-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `fortigate-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The Fortigate Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplimented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).

## Discovering Certificate Stores with the Discovery Job
For SSL Certificate (F5-SL-REST) and CA Bundle (F5-CA-REST) store types, discovery jobs can be scheduled to find F5 partitions that can be configured as Keyfactor Command certificate stores.

First, in Keyfactor Command navigate to Certificate Locations =\> Certificate Stores. Select the Discover tab and then the Schedule button. Complete the dialog and click Done to schedule.
![](images/image14.png)

- **Category** - Required. The F5 store type you wish to find stores for.

- **Orchestrator** - Select the orchestrator you wish to use to manage this store

- **Client Machine & Credentials** - Required.  The server name or IP Address and login credentials for the F5 device.  The credentials for server login can be any of:

  - UserId/Password
  - PAM provider information to pass the UserId/Password or UserId/SSH private key credentials
  
  When entering the credentials, UseSSL ***must*** be selected.
  
- **When** - Required. The date and time when you would like this to execute.

- **Directories to search** - Required but not used. This field is not used in the search to Discover certificate stores, but ***is*** a required field in this dialog, so just enter any value.  It will not be used.

- **Directories to ignore/Extensions/File name patterns to match/Follow SymLinks/Include PKCS12 Files** - Not used.  Leave blank.

Once the Discovery job has completed, a list of F5 certificate store locations should show in the Certificate Stores Discovery tab in Keyfactor Command. Right click on a store and select Approve to bring up a dialog that will ask for the remaining necessary certificate store parameters described in Step 2a.  Complete those and click Save, and the Certificate Store should now show up in the list of stores in the Certificate Stores tab.
