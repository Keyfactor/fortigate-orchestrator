## Fortigate Orchestrator Extension Installation  

1. Create the Fortigate certificate store type.  This can be done either: a) using the Keyfactor Command UI to manually set up the certificate store type (please refer to the Keyfactor Command Reference Guide for more information on how to do this), or b) by using the Keyfactor Command API to automate the creation of the store type.  Please see the provided CURL script [here](Certificate%20Store%20Type%20CURL%20Script/Fortigate.curl).  A detailed description of how the Fortigate certificate store type should be configured can be found in the Fortigate Certificate Store Type section below.
2. Stop the Keyfactor Orchestrator Service on the server hosting the Keyfactor Orchestrator.
3. In the Keyfactor Orchestrator installation folder (by convention usually C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator), find the "extensions" folder. Underneath that, create a new folder.  The name doesn't matter, but something descriptive like "Fortigate" would probably be best.
4. Download the latest version of the Fortigate Orchestrator from [GitHub](https://github.com/Keyfactor/fortigate-orchestrator).
5. Copy the contents of the download installation zip file to the folder created in step 1.
6. Start the Keyfactor Orchestrator Service on the server hosting the Keyfactor Orchestrator.
